                Operating the global routing ecosystem entails a divers set of interacting components, while operational practice evolved over time.
                In that time, terms emerged, disappeared, and sometimes changed their meaning.

                To aid operators and implementers in reading contemporary drafts, this document provides an overview of terms and abbreviations used in the global routing operations community.
                The document explicitly does not serve as an authoritative source of correct terminology, but instead strives to provide an overview of practice.
