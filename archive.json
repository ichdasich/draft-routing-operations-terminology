(See: [RFC9234], also known as the customer in a customer-provider relationship.)\r\n Upstream:\r\n   In a direct relationship between two ASes the one providing upstream to the other. (See: [RFC9234], also known as the provider in a customer-provider relationship.)\r\n Providing Transit:\r\n   Forwarding packets destined for addresses in an advertised prefix, while advertising a full BGP table or default route to the neighbor.\r\n Providing Upstream:\r\n   See: Providing Transit\r\n\r\nEspecially with the definition for \"Upstream\", it took me reading the whole of the section to understand that you don't actually have a circular definition there. If you change the definitions in the \"Downstream\" and \"Upstream\" sections to refer to providing or receiving \"transit\" instead of \"upstream\" I feel that it would read more clearly as well as pointing to a term has its own definition without pointing to another term.\r\n",
